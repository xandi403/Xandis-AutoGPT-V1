self.abilities = AbilityRegister(self)
While AbilityRegister is studded with utility methods, two stand out. The list_abilities_for_prompt method curates and structures abilities for prompt integration. Conversely, run_ability operationalizes the designated ability, translating it from code to action.
An abilityâ€™s DNA comprises a function embellished with the @ability decorator and mandatorily paired with parameters, notably the agent and task_id.

            "required": True,
        },
